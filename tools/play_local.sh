# play_local.sh -- two consoles side by side on this machine, playable.
#
#   tools/play_local.sh            (or: make play)
#
# Sets up and starts everything a two-player session needs, then tears it
# all down when either MAME window closes (or on Ctrl-C):
#   - two isolated fujinet-pc-rs232 copies (build/play/fn1, fn2; BoIP on
#     :19861 / :19862, web UI on :18091 / :18092), each with its own
#     username appkey and the Lobby's server-URL appkey pointing at the relay
#   - the relay (dd_relay_server.py) on :PLAY_PORT
#   - two windowed MAMEs running build/dd_net.nes on the FujiNet cart slot
#
# In each window: pick the other player from the lobby (Up/Down, A or
# Start) -- or just wait in one window and challenge from the other. The
# player who waited is 1UP. Each console plays with ITS OWN controller 1
# (MAME's default player-1 keys); keyboard input goes to the focused
# window, so click the one you are playing on.
#
# Environment:
#   P1_NAME / P2_NAME  lobby names, 2-8 of A-Z 0-9 (PLAYONE / PLAYTWO)
#   PLAY_PORT          relay port (9700)
#   DELAY              lockstep input delay in ticks, handed out by the
#                      relay (3)
#   GAME_APPKEY        the Lobby handoff key the ROM reads (40)
#   FNPC_DIST          fujinet-pc build to copy
#                      (~/Workspace/fujinet-pc-rs232/build/dist)
