# Production launch on the shared host: relay on the game's port, registered
# as a room on the FujiNet Lobby for platform "nes".
#
# Port 9700 and appkey 40 are this port's PROPOSED assignments (9100-9115
# are the Intellivision games, 9600-9604 the 2600 ones; appkeys 10-27 are
# taken) -- confirm both before the first production start. The appkey must
# match the ROM's GAME_APPKEY (make GAME_APPKEY=n): the NES Lobby hands the
# booted ROM this room's serverurl through that key.
#
# Override via the environment: PORT, LOBBY_URL, LOBBY_APPKEY,
# LOBBY_SERVERURL, LOBBY_CLIENT_URL. Never run this against a test rig; rigs
# stay unregistered (make rig uses 127.0.0.1 and no --lobby-enabled).
